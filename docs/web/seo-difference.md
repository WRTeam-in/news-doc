2. If you have added meta title, meta description and meta keywords for news then meta title will render on title bar of every news detail page and this data will help search engines to rank up the page.
3. You can share the news with its image and its title.

## Without SEO

1. Meta title, meta description and meta keywords you have added in your .env file that will be same for every page.
2. You can't share the news with its image and title.

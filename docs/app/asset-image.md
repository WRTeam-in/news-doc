# How to Change Images in Asset?

To change the images used in your News App:

1. Go to the `assets > images` folder. Here you need to replace the existing images with your own custom images according to different folder dimensions.

2. Make sure to maintain the same filenames and image dimensions for proper functioning of the app.

3. If you add new image folders, ensure they are properly referenced in the `pubspec.yaml` file as shown below:

![Image Assets](/images/app/img.png)

The app loads images from these asset directories based on references in the code, so proper organization is important.

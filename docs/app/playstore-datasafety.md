## Key Data Safety Considerations

When filling out the data safety section for your News App, consider the following data types that may need to be disclosed:

1. **User Information**

   - Email address
   - Name
   - Phone number
   - User IDs

2. **Device Information**

   - Device or other IDs
   - Location

3. **App Activity**
   - In-app search history
   - Installed apps
   - Other actions

## Best Practices

- Be transparent about all data your app collects
- Only claim data is encrypted if you're using industry-standard encryption
- Indicate whether data collection is optional or required for app functionality
- Specify how long data is retained and if users can request deletion
- Mention if data is shared with third parties (ad networks, analytics, etc.)

2. Modify the following settings as needed:

```dart
// App configuration
static const bool IS_THEME_MODE_CHANGEABLE = true; // Enable/disable theme switching
static const bool IS_RTL_ENABLED = false; // Enable for right-to-left languages
static const int DEFAULT_LANGUAGE_ID = 1; // Default language ID from backend

// Content loading
static const int LOAD_ITEM_LIMIT = 10; // Number of items to load at once
